# Neural-Network
Feedforward Sigmoidal MLP that can be trained for supervised learning. I built the network using numpy and matrices, and used it to classify handwritten digits within the MNIST dataset. I created the network as my final projet for machine learning in high school. The network uses a soigmoid activation function and backpropogation for training on labeled datasets. Run train.py to create and train a network on the MNIST dataset. Network.py gives more information on how the network functions and the methods it uses. Loader.py is simply for loading and transforming the Mnist dataset into training and test data.
